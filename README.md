Hello there! This is a first web development project of mine.

I've been programming with Java for quite a while now. But my passion is moving to the Front End rather quickly
This is a pretty simple tribute page to the most passionate human right activist of the 20th century - Martin Luther King. 

The page is made with HTML and CSS. It is fully responsive and can be read comfortably from any screen.

Please let me know if I have made any mistakes or my code could be refactored in a more efficient way. Thanks in advance!
